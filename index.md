## About Me
Hi, I'm David Jiang! I participate in CyberPatriot, and I enjoy it, but am very bad at it. Like Cyberpatriot, I enjoy listening to music but cannot make any. I enjoy English, and dislike other languages. I am terrible at learning new langauages, and struggle at learning Spanish because my memory is bad. I also dislike social studies. My goals are to get better at educational things, and my short term goal is to get full max netherite armor so I can host events on the server that I play on. I talk often on discord, and have most notifications on so I will respond quickly. Finally, coding is something that seems cool to me but it seems very complex to me and I feel like it will be a big struggle coding a game.

## Overview of Hacks, Study and Tangibles
Blogging in GitHub pages is a way to learn and code at the same time. 

- Plans, Lists, [Scrum Boards](https://clickup.com/blog/scrum-board/) help you to track key events, show progress and record time.  Effort is a big part of your class grade.  Show plans and time spent!
- [Hacks(Todo)](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/six-ultimate-daily-hacks-for-every-programmer-60f5f10feae) enable you to stay in focus with key requirements of the class.  Each Hack will produce Tangibles.
- Tangibles or [Tangible Artifacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(software_development)) are things you accumulate as a learner and coder.
