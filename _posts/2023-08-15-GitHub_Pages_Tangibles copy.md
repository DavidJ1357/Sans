###    Summary of Accomplishments
> This week I was able to install all the neccessary tools that I needed. These tools included VScode, Ubuntu terminal for Windows, and cloned the student repository, naming it "Sans". I also was able to make a Github account. I already had VScode, but I was able to set it up, opening it in WSL.
### Challenges and Solutions during Week 0
> There were not many, but a few roadblocks during Week 0. One roadblock was that I was confused and overestimated the complexity of what would happen, looking only at the hard code. Near the end of the week, I realized that we would start off slow. I also had trouble looking at the screen of the teacher presenting how to do things because I was near the back of the room and could not see the code clearly. This forced me to rely on hearing and asking for extra help. I also struggled to find things to do, because I already had a ittle more knowledge than the average Amercian about a computer, so the setup was pretty easy. The coding part of the plan was unsuccessful, as we were starting slow, and didn't start coding yet; but I think I would have struggled a lot if I had started coding this week, so it is good that we didn't.
