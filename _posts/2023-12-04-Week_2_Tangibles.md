### Week 2 Accomplishments
 To start off this week, I was able to make posts for my plans, hacks, and tangibles. In the hacks page, I managed to add color, fonts, and a video. I was able to insert the video without requiring help, and there were really no roadblocks embeding the video, as it did not require much insight on HTML or any type of coding.

### Week 2 Roadblocks
During this week, one roadblock that I encountered was not being able to change the color of my hacks background. I typed in some necessary code, but it did not work. The reason for this was there were weird permalinks that linked it all to the week 2 plans, because the top format was all copies of the week 2 plans. Another problem was that the fonts were not working. I managed to solve this by myself using chatGPT, and importanting a font from google fonts. This gave me some inisght into HTML.
