### PBL Unit 1 / Week 2

<p>Usually, coding would go here, but we have not started coding yet because it is still week two, so I will just write about some things that I learned in this class. One thing that I learned is that you can easily insert text with VScode, at least with this template. I also learned how to make posts. To make a post, you just need to go to _posts, change the type to what you are posting about, and make the title and description. From there, you can just write under it. I also learned how to edit the fonts with HTML. I managed to embed a video onto the website myself. I decided to put the song "Undertale" on it, but Megalovania is better in my opinion.
